PyBIDS is a Python library to centralize interactions with datasets conforming
BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format.  For more information about BIDS
visit http://bids.neuroimaging.io.

Get started by checking out [the documentation!](https://incf.github.io/pybids)

Or you can start at [our tutorial!](examples/pybids%20tutorial.ipynb). You can even run it interactively without installing anything via [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KirstieJane/pybids/master?filepath=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FKirstieJane%2Fpybids%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fexamples%2Fpybids%2520tutorial.ipynb)
